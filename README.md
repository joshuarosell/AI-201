**Predicting Heart Attack Risk**
---
This study evaluates and compares the performance of three machine
learning models – Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural
Network – on a heart dataset to determine the most effective model
for classification tasks, in particular, whether a patient has a high risk
or low risk of heart attack. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and
Area Under the Curve or AUC were employed as metrics to assess the
models’ performance. The models were trained and tested on the dataset
and their respective performance metrics were calculated. The Artificial
Neural Network outperformed the other models across all metrics, demonstrating
the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, making it
the best-performing model for this dataset. Logistic Regression, while
slightly lower in performance metrics compared to ANN, showed strong
interpretability and simplicity. Naive Bayes, despite being the least effective
model in terms of performance metrics, offered a balance of simplicity
and speed. Both Logistic Regression and ANN exhibited excellent
AUC scores, indicating their strong ability to distinguish between classes
and reliability in classification tasks. Naive Bayes was less effective but
still a valuable option depending on specific requirements. Overall, ANN
emerged as the most suitable model for applications requiring high performance
while Logistic Regression remained a strong contender for scenarios
prioritizing interpretability and simplicity.
